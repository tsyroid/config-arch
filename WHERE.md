## Where am I at?

[2024.10.03 - 2024.10.04]

- [x] Wiped out all previous Waybar and Waypaper efforts
- [x] Reorganized, resorted, re-edited, refactored `hypr/*.conf`, `hypr/scripts/*.conf`
- [x] Finally dumped Firefox. Remove all cache files, config files, and anything associated. Product is still functionally installed.
- [x] I revitalized Brave and ensured everything works; TODO: still haunted by fucking kdewalletrc.
- [x] I have a 'blank canvas' desktop
- [x] I have used (cleanly --> no dureitis (sp?) leftover): $TERMINAL=kitty; $browser=brave
- [ ] Intend to reboot, restart, and generally heavily use/test everything to-date. NO GREMLINS!




## NEXT

- [ ] Wallpaper: swww? or waypaper? or ??
- [ ] Waybar basic
- [ ] Waybar advanced (between the above and here there's gonna be some detours...)
